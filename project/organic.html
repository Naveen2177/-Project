                Buying organic guarantees that the food you are eating contains no toxic pesticides or chemicals,
                no synthetic growth hormones or antibiotics, no GMOs, no artificial additives or preservatives,
                and is grown/raised using organic farming methods. Organic is always natural and non-GMO,
                but the opposite cannot be said.
            </p>
            <p>
                How your food is grown or raised can have a major impact on your mental and emotional health as well as
                the environment. Organic foods often have more beneficial nutrients, such as antioxidants, than their
                conventionally-grown counterparts and people with allergies to foods, chemicals, or preservatives may
                find their symptoms lessen or go away when they eat only organic foods.
            </p>

            <p>
                Organic produce contains fewer pesticides. Chemicals such as synthetic fungicides, herbicides, and
                insecticides are widely used in conventional agriculture and residues remain on (and in) the food we
                eat.
            </p>

            <p>
                Organic food is often fresher because it doesn't contain preservatives that make it last longer. Organic
                produce is sometimes (but not always, so watch where it is from) produced on smaller farms nearer to
                where it is sold.
            </p>

            <p>
                Organic farming tends to be better for the environment. Organic farming practices may reduce pollution,
                conserve water, reduce soil erosion, increase soil fertility, and use less energy. Farming without
                synthetic pesticides is also better for nearby birds and animals as well as people who live close to
                farms.
            </p>

            <p>
                Organically raised animals are NOT given antibiotics, growth hormones, or fed animal byproducts. Feeding
                livestock animal byproducts increases the risk of mad cow disease (BSE) and the use of antibiotics can
                create antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria. Organically-raised animals tend to be given more space
                to move around and access to the outdoors, which helps to keep them healthy.
            </p>

            <p>
                Organic meat and milk can be richer in certain nutrients. Results of a 2016 European study show that
                levels of certain nutrients, including omega-3 fatty acids, were up to 50 percent higher in organic meat
                and milk than in conventionally raised versions.
            </p>

            <p>
                Organic food is GMO-free. Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) or genetically engineered (GE) foods are
                plants whose DNA has been altered in ways that cannot occur in nature or in traditional crossbreeding,
                most commonly in order to be resistant to pesticides or produce an insecticide.
